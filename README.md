TASK: To predict weight of a person based on their height using Linear Regression(Supervised ML).

Linear regression quantifies the relationship between one or more predictor variable(s) and one outcome variable. Linear regression is commonly used for predictive analysis and modeling. For example, it can be used to quantify the relative impacts of age, gender, and diet (the predictor variables) on height (the outcome variable).

Linear Regression can be considered a Machine Learning algorithm that allows us to map numeric inputs to numeric outputs, fitting a line into the data points. Linear Regression as an algorithm relies on the concept of lowering the cost to maximize the performance.
